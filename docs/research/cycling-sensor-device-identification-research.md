## 📡 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Sensor Identification

### Standard Service UUIDs for Cycling Sensors

All major cycling sensors use standardized Bluetooth GATT service UUIDs defined by the Bluetooth SIG:

#### Core Cycling Services
```
• Cycling Speed and Cadence Service (CSCS): 0x1816
  - Supports speed and/or cadence measurements
  - Can operate in speed-only, cadence-only, or combined modes
  
• Cycling Power Service (CPS): 0x1818  
  - Reports total power output, power per pedal
  - Includes speed, cadence, torque measurements
  - Superset of CSCS functionality

• Heart Rate Service (HRS): 0x180D
  - Standard heart rate measurements
  - Used by all major HRM manufacturers

• Fitness Machine Service (FTMS): 0x1826

  - Supports resistance control and workout programs
```

#### Associated Characteristic UUIDs
```
• Cycling Power Measurement: 0x2A63
• Cycling Power Feature: 0x2A65

```

### Device Detection Implementation Pattern

Based on open source project analysis, the standard BLE device detection pattern is:

1. **Service UUID Filtering**: Scan for devices advertising cycling-related service UUIDs

• Fitness Equipment (FE-C): 0x11 (Smart Trainers)
```

### Manufacturer Identification

ANT+ devices include manufacturer information via standardized data pages:

#### Common Page 80 - Manufacturer's Information
- **2-byte Manufacturer ID** assigned by ANT+ consortium
- **Fixed string mapping** for user-displayable manufacturer names

#### Known Manufacturer IDs
```
• Garmin: 0x0001
• Dynastream (ANT+ creator): 0x0010

## 🛠️ Implementation Approaches from Open Source Projects

### Service UUID-Based Detection (Primary Method)

Most successful projects use service UUID filtering as the primary detection method:

```javascript
// Example approach from research
const CYCLING_SERVICES = [
    '0x180d', // Heart Rate
    '0x1818', // Cycling Power  
    '0x1816', // Cycling Speed and Cadence
    '0x1826'  // Fitness Machine
];

async function scanForCyclingSensors() {
    // Scan specifically for cycling-related services
    await noble.startScanning(CYCLING_SERVICES, false);
}
```

### Multi-Service Compatibility Strategy

Research revealed that some devices require specific service implementations:

- **Garmin Watches**: May require CSCS service even when power meter implements CPS
- **Maximum Compatibility**: Implement both CSCS and CPS when power measurement is available
- **Service Advertisement**: Include service UUIDs in advertisement data using little-endian format

### Device Categorization Logic

Successful projects categorize devices based on supported services:

```javascript
function categorizeDevice(serviceUuids, manufacturerData) {
    const services = serviceUuids.map(uuid => uuid.toLowerCase());
    
    // Primary categorization by service capability
    if (services.includes('1818')) return 'power_meter';
    if (services.includes('1816')) return 'speed_cadence';  
    if (services.includes('180d')) return 'heart_rate';
    if (services.includes('1826')) return 'smart_trainer';
    
    return 'unknown';
}
```

## 📊 Technical Implementation Patterns

### Device Discovery Flow

1. **Concurrent Protocol Scanning**: Scan ANT+ and BLE simultaneously
2. **Service-First Identification**: Use service UUIDs as primary categorization method
3. **Manufacturer Enhancement**: Add manufacturer info for better user experience
4. **Capability Detection**: Query specific characteristics to determine full device capabilities
5. **User-Friendly Naming**: Combine service type + manufacturer + model for display names

### Data Structure Design

Recommended device information structure:

```typescript
interface SensorDevice {
    // Core identification
    deviceId: string;
    protocol: 'ant_plus' | 'bluetooth';
    
    // Service capabilities  
    services: string[];
    deviceType: 'heart_rate' | 'power' | 'speed_cadence' | 'trainer';
    
    // Manufacturer information
    manufacturerId?: number;
    manufacturerName?: string;
    
    // Display information
    localName?: string;
    displayName: string;
    
    // Technical details
    signalStrength?: number;
    lastSeen: Date;
}
